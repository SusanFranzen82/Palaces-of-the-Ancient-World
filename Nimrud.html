            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">History</h2>
            <p class="lead">The New Assyrian period was the third and final period of great Assyrian power. Assur, the traditional capital, was soon deemed too small, and not long after Assyria began its first phase of expansion, the capital was moved by Assurnasirpal II to Kalhu (current name Nimrud). Kalhu is first mentioned in written sources in the 13th century BC, but there is archaeological evidence that there was already habitation in the early 3rd millennium. The position of the city,  in the heart of Assyria and with excellent communication facilities, made it a suitable place for a capital. The construction of the city and the palace lasted most of Assurnasirpal's reign. Kalhu was not only the king's main residence, the great state ceremonies took place there and legations paid tribute and gifts to the king, also during the reigns of Tiglath-Pileser III and even of Sargon II. As far as we know, it remained the royal capital until Sargon founded Dur-Sarrukin, and the city continued to exist until the last years of the New Assyrian Empire.</p>
            <p>The archeological site of Nimrud was tragically largely destroyed by IS in 2015.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Excavations</h2>
            <p class="lead">The earliest modern mention of Nimrud is made by Claudius James Rich, who visited it in 1820. He collected some antique fragments, which were sent to the British Museum. Austen Henry Layard first visited Nimrud in 1839-40 and returned in 1845 to excavate. On the first day of his excavations, he found room A of the Northwest Palace of Assurnasirpal II, but also a wall of the Southwest Palace of Esarhaddon. For financial and practical reasons, the excavations were mainly carried out by digging tunnels along the stone slabs, which were considered the most important finds. <br>
              Because of his limited resources, Layard did a lot himself. He copied the inscriptions, drew the reliefs, made casts, and helped remove and pack the reliefs. This changed when the British Museum started funding the excavations, with money from the government, partly because of the rivalry that had arisen between the museum and the Louvre in Paris. <br> 
              In 1846 the excavations continued, with the help of Hormuzd Rassam, a brother of the British Vice-Consul in Mosul. Layard left for England in 1851 and never returned to Iraq. Rassam took charge until 1853, both here and on other excavations, after which the British Museum appointed Colonel Henry Creswicke Rawlinson as head of the excavations in Assyria. The finds on the sites, after the great successes of the past, were disappointing and it seemed that the excavations would be abandoned. <br>
              Rawlinson enlisted the help of the Assyrian Excavation Fund (AEF), a private organization, which funded the excavations. William Kenneth Loftus, of the AEF, came to Nimrud at Rawlinson's request and excavated there in 1854-1855. In 1855 the era of great excavations ended (partly because of the Crimean War and because the emphasis was placed on the cuneiform tablets). Rassam briefly returned to Nimrud between 1878-1880 on behalf of the British Museum, but no more was excavated.
