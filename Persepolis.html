        <p class="lead">Darius is generally seen as the great organizer of the empire. Although satraps already existed during the reigns of Cyrus and Cambyses and tributes had to be provided, Darius developed this system into a clear administration with 20 satrapies and a tax system in which the amount of the tax was fixed and adapted to the payer's ability to pay. In addition, Darius built the largest and most important capital of the Achaemenid Empire:  Persepolis. It was Cyrus who chose the place where Persepolis would be located. Remains of palaces and gates and of buildings have been found, indicating that the process of urbanization had already begun before Darius' time. Because of Cyrus' work, the area was already an important, populated area with trade contacts and was thus able to provide the resources the king needed for his grand plans. Darius, however, did not build his city on the plain like Cyrus, but on a monumental terrace of about 0.125 km2 that he built from scratch to found his city. From Darius we know that he built his palace (although this was completed by Xerxes), the Treasury (although it was smaller than the one we know today), the Council Chamber and the Apadana. Darius wanted to radiate his new power and transfer it to posterity: he did this by building intensely. Darius built the Treasury as an administrative center and for storage and this was the first to be finished.

        <p class="lead">Unlike the palaces of for example Nineveh, which had been buried, the ruins of Persepolis, the monumental capital of the Achaemenid Empire in present-day Iran, had always remained visible. The ruins of a number of colossal buildings, all made of dark gray marble from the nearby mountain, were clearly visible, there were even 15 pillars still standing. In 1931 there was an American expedition, set up by the University of Chicago. The excavations were led from 1931-1934 by Ernst Herzfeld and from 1934-1939 by Erich Schmidt.
