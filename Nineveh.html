        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">History</h2>
        <p class="lead">In 704, when Dur-Sarrukin was just completed, Sennacherib made the city of Nineveh, some 20 kilometers southeast of Dur-Sarrukin, the administrative capital of the New Assyrian Empire. Although it only became the most important city in the country under Sennacherib, it had long been an important city and cult center. Sennacherib wanted to make Nineveh a city that would amaze the civilized world with its size and its splendor. He built canals and stone aqueducts that brought water from the Zagros Mountains, some 65-80 km away, into the city to irrigate the parks, orchards and allotments of Nineveh. He rebuilt the North Palace and built his own palace, the Southwest Palace, which he called "the unparalleled palace," on Kuyunjik Hill. 
          Sennacherib's son, Esarhaddon, was able to devote himself almost entirely to ensuring security at the borders due to the military achievements of his predecessors. He also built a palace in Nineveh, but on the hill Nebi Yunus. Because this hill later became sacred ground, it is not allowed to excavate. However, he also built a palace in Kalhu, the Southwest Palace, just east of the Northwest Palace of Assurnasirpal. Esarhaddon died on his way to another campaign in Egypt in 669, but his son Ashurbanipal conquered Egypt. In addition, he defeated the king of Elam, who had supported a rebellion in Babylon, and destroyed Susa. Ashurbanipal repaired Sennacherib's palace and rebuilt the North Palace, also on Kuyunjik, just north of the Southwest Palace.
          In 614 BC, the Medes (under Cyaxares) and the Babylonians (under Nabopolassar) made an alliance against Assyria. In 612, together they attacked Nineveh, which was conquered after 2 months. The city was looted and destroyed.

        <p class="lead">Botta was the first to excavate on Kuyunjik in 1842, until he exchanged the site for Khorsabad. <br>
          Layard began excavating there in the summer of 1846, after the successful excavations at Nimrud. He moved out in June 1847, after which the excavations were taken over by H.J. Ross. Ross left in July 1848, and in September 1849 Layard returned. Until 1851 he excavated the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib, making many of the drawings of the reliefs himself.<br>
          When he left, he had unearthed 71 chambers and some 3 kilometers of reliefs. As in Nimrud, Rassam took over under the general leadership of Rawlinson until 1853. In 1853, just as british museum funds were running out, Rassam discovered the North Palace of Assurbanipal. After Rassam's departure, Loftus took over for just over a year.<br>
          When the great excavations ceased after 1855, the British Museum ordered the reburial of plates that were not removed, although many of them were later excavated and sold by traders. <br>
          From 1872, the British Museum periodically sent expeditions to Iraq, and occasionally finds were made, but no more large palaces. In the years 1873 and 1874, George Smith excavated more parts of the Southwest Palace, and between 1878 and 1882 Rassam again led the excavations. This was followed by E.A.W. Budge (1889-1890), L.W. King (1903-1904) and R.C. Thompson (1904-1905 and 1931-1932). <br>
          The most recent excavations took place between 1965 and 1967, led by Tariq Madhloom on behalf of the Iraqi Department of Antiquities. Parts of the palaces were excavated, allowing visitors to see the plates in place. However, many of these were damaged in the 90s of the last century.</p>
