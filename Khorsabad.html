    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">History</h2>
    <p class="lead">Between 745 and 705, the Assyrian Empire took its final form and imperial rule was elaborated and refined. In the time of Tiglath-Pileser III, the expansion policy of Assyria was adjusted; The emphasis, which once lay on the control of trade and raw materials, now shifted to actual political dominance of foreign territories and peoples. At the end of Tiglath-Pileser's reign, the Assyrian Empire covered an area from present-day southern Turkey to the borders of Egypt (including Syria, Gaza, Israel, Judah). The power of the state of Urartu had been significantly reduced, and Babylon and Israel were now Assyrian provinces. After Sargon II, the influence of Assyria could be felt as far as central Anatolia (southern Cappadocia). As mentioned earlier, Sargon II founded a new capital: Dur-Sarrukin, north of Kalhu. Sargon personally chose the village of Magganubba, at the foot of Mount Musri, north of Nineveh. The local inhabitants were compensated for their land by payment with silver or copper, or by land in nearby areas. The construction of the city lasted from 717 to 707 BC.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Excavations</h2>
    <p class="lead">Early in 1843, Paul Emile Botta, the French consul in Mosul, began exploring the site of Nineveh, but other than small, insignificant stones, he found no evidence of an ancient site. A local brought him several stones with cuneiform inscriptions, which came from the village of Khorsabad. Botta went there and during his preliminary excavations found parts of a wall, on which reliefs and inscriptions could be seen, later revealed to be the palace of Sargon II in his new capital, Dur-Sarrukin. Botta, who at the time believed he had found Nineveh, sent sketches to France, after which the French government gave him permission for the excavation. In 1844, the artist Eugene-Napoleon Flandin was sent by the French government to Khorsabad to draw the architecture (floor plan) and the sculptures. After Botta completed his excavations in 1844, the site was abandoned. Small finds and parts of wall reliefs were exhibited in the Louvre.<br> 
    From 1853 to 1855, work was resumed in Khorsabad by Victor Place, then French consul in Mosul. He expanded Botta's excavations and made a map of the palace with the many courts and surrounding rooms. In 1927, an American team of archaeologists from the Oriental Institute in Chicago came to the site after several pieces of stone with inscriptions and reliefs were found. During the work, which took place between 1929 and 1935, a few rooms in the palace were reopened and the throne room was uncovered. A number of temples were also found around a large central court and several private residences. Finds were divided between the Iraqi government and the Oriental Institute. <br>  
    After the departure of the Americans, a brief investigation was carried out by the Iraqi government in 1938, but after that no large, systematic excavations took place in Khorsabad. </p>
